# About

[nPython](https://9off.pythonanywhere.com/)- online python interpreter created for me by me
(u also can selfhost nPython)

# Need to install
* python3 and pip
* Flask python lib

# How to run nPython
```sh
git clone https://github.com/KriperPlay/nPython/
cd nPython
python3 app.py
```
connect to ```https://127.0.0.1:5000```(after run app.py) or [nPython](https://9off.pythonanywhere.com/) (if u dont want to selfhost nPython)

# Settings
* u can add ban words, so that block some modules or something else
(banwords also worked in "", so add banwords wisely)

# How to use
## Thath nPython doesnt supported/blocked
* nPython doesnt support inputs!!
    ```python
    a = input()
    print(f"msg: {a}")
    # This doesnt will work
    ```
* nPython doesnt support arguments(sys)
  ```python
  a = sys.argv[1]
  print(f"sys.argv[1] = {a}")
  # This doesnt will work
  ```
* My banwords u can check in ban_words.py
## Tips
* That so run code, u can click button 'Run code' or press 'ctrl+alt'
